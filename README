1. i added postMan.json file for you if you want to check only the api just change the localhost

2. if you want to check the api with getFilterCustomers the query params can be null but should not be include in the request
   getFilterCustomers/?from=3 -> return from id 3 until the end and all types
   getFilterCustomers/?to=3&type="TYPE" -> return from the lowest id to id == 3 and only customer type == "TYPE"
